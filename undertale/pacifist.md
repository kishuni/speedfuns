# Undertale - True Pacifist Route

## Records
[speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale#True_Pacifist_Ending)

## Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the True Pacifist route, which requires achieving a Neutral ending at least once during the run.
- Time begins on "YES" during name select and ends on the last text box you go through with Toriel.

-----

## Tricks and info
- Wallhumping: Holding `UP` + `DOWN` while against an upper wall allows you to rapidly swap between facing up and down, which is good for battle hunting.
- Holding `X / SHIFT` while in battle allows your SOUL to move slower.
- SAVE sparingly.
- Rapidly hitting `Z / ENTER` and `X / SHIFT` allows rapid text though most dialogue.
- Battle notes below will not include `MERCY`: `Spare`. It is assumed unless otherwise stated.

## These Notes
- Written from the current [WR by Celestics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYbMA_jgv2M) as linked. 
- (As of writing, time is 1:53:35.)

-----

## Beginning

Name the Fallen Human a one character name.

## Ruins

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Froggit | `Compliment+Spare | Flee` | It is faster to hit the frog than wait for it to leap. 2G for sparing tactic.
Whimsun | `Terrorize+Spare | Flee` | 2G for sparing tactic.
Moldsmal | `Imitate+Spare | Spare` | 1G for imitating before sparing. Always faster to Spare than Flee.
Napstablook | `Cheer+Cheer+Cheer+Flirt` | *Really not feelin up to it right now. Sorry.*
Loox | `Flee` |
Vegetoid | `Flee` |

### Flowey
- It's faster to hit the bullets. Run into them into the upper right corner, then into the circle at the bottom left.

### Dummy
- `ACT`: `Talk`

Wallhump for the switches to save time.

You will need `7 GOLD` by the time you get to the Spider Bakesale to purchase a Spider Donut. Four battles are needed.

Run from the Froggit in the Spike puzzle room.

After being given the CELL, get 2G in the next room.

The room after, Wallhump to force another encounter for 2G.

In the room with the first rock, the Pie question does not matter. Just mash through it. Force an encounter to get 2G.

In the room with the three rocks, go to the bottom of the rock and talk to it twice. Make a roundabout to the back of the rock such that the third time you talk to it you get pushed towards the spikes. Reset the spikes and move back to the right side of the rock; if lucky, you can force an encounter AND also talk to the rock before the `FIGHT` begins. The worst encounter you can possibly get in this room is 2 Froggits since you must take 2 cycles. Otherwise get at least 1G through one turn and then keep moving.

Pick up the `Faded Ribbon` in the last pitfall room (bottom left hole).

In case you don't remember, the Perspective Rooms (in order):
- Top column
- Red switch
- Leftmost column

## Home
Toriel heals you immediately, so no need to `SAVE`.

Sleep immediately.

Pick up the `Butterscotch Pie`.

When mashing through Toriel's text, listen to the bit on snails first (2 dialogue prompts) and select `How to exit the RUINS` on the third and final prompt.

Enemy | `ACT`
:---- | :----
Toriel | `Spare`

> Hit the hand attacks. These are the fast ones. Ideally you can skip 5 of these.

> Hang around the upper left corner for the other fire vortex attacks. (Avoid them so you can get hands.)

> Getting to `2 HP` will force Toriel to not attack you. This is your 6th possible skip in the fight.

The best time possible for this segment is around 7:40, give or take a few seconds.

## Path to Snowdin

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Snowdrake | `Flee` |
Doggo | `Stick` |
Married Dogs | `Stick` |
Greater Dog | `Stick` |

> The `Stick` will allow you to bypass all dog-type enemies after using it once and then `SPARE`ing them after.

`SAVE` here to heal to full.

Pick up the `Tough Glove` from the `Box` and equip it.

No need to check the crossword puzzle.

Hit the switch before the Married Dogs. Make sure to flee from the Lesser Dog.

Hit the switch in the tree with the large X/O puzzle.

The ice sliding puzzle has a specific strategy that saves 1 second as opposed to simply doing the cinnamon swirl solution. Look at the current record video to see how to do this.

Say that `No` and `Even less` to the questions in the Colored Block puzzle room.

If you get the BARK BARK attack from Greater Dog, you can skip it by running into the dog at the bottom.

## Snowdin Town

Purchase the `Manly Bandanna (50 GOLD)` in the Shop. Don't equip it yet.

Take the Underground Tunnel to the other side of town.

### Papyrus
It is faster to let him capture (kill) you three times (by 45 seconds!).

Head back to his home to hang out with him.

Go straight to his room and talk with him.

Mash through the hangout. If he's staring at you, mash C to advance. 

Select his hat. Platonically.

It's faster to not eat the spaghetti, but the menuing is difficult.

## Waterfall

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Aaron | `Flee` | *Who wouldn't?*
Woshua | `Flee` |
Moldsmal | `Spare` |
Shyren | `Flee` |
Temmie | `fLE E!!` |

Pick up the `Old Tutu` in the room after Sans (behind the waterfall).

In the final lilypad room, drop them upwards using the downmost ledge.

### Undyne Spears 1
Dodge the spears???

No need for the umbrella. Just wastes time.

Wallhumping through castle is faster.

### Undyne Spears 2: The Reckoning
You can manipulate these spears by moving all the way up or all the way down in a sort of zig-zag pattern.

### Dummy!
- Mash `SPARE`.
- Hit him with as much cotton as possible. He can be three-cycled, although this is difficult.
- Unlike the cotton, which is hit-based, the rockets are move-based.
- Hit the knife to get rid of it faster.

`SAVE` here to heal to full.

Purchase the `Cloudy Glasses`.

Memorize the pathing for the Mushroom Room and the Lantern Room.

Do not help Monster Kid from the bridge. It's faster. (Sorry!)

### Undyne
- New strat to skip the first dialog and encounter. http://webm.host/5d78a/
- Hit `Challenge` as it makes the spears go faster.
- `Flee` ASAP.
- During the final phase, you want to finish off at `1 HP` by getting hit by three arrows and a spear at the end. This makes MTT's quiz go faster.

Be sure to water your Undyne!

## Hotland

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Vulkin | `Flee` |
Tsunderplane | `F-Flee!` |
Pyrope | `Flee` |

Go to the top so when Alphys comes out of the elevator, it saves walking time. Same for after the fight, walk towards the top.

### Mettaton Quiz
- Hit `[A] Money` to skip to the last question and end the battle.
- `[A] Undyne` for the final question is the fastest.

Save after the Lab to heal to full. There's a save point two maps after the lab.

### Slide Puzzle 1 (Right)
Up, Left, Fire

### Slide Puzzle 2 (Left)
Up, Left, Down, Left, Fire

### Cooking with a Killer Robot
- Walking upwards while the room is dark gets you closer to the food to pick up.
- When placing food, place it leftmost to prevent mashing through to talking with MTT.
- Best time for Human SOUL substitute is 15 seconds on the dot.

Pick up the `Stained Apron` (downward path after going up).

### Jumping Puzzle
In case you forgot, left, down, down, up down, left, up, up, left.
- Alternatively, there's a glitch you can do that requires you to open the menu the same frame(?) you land on the platform. http://webm.host/b71a6/
- Consistent setup I found (for me) was mashing CTRL/C as you land onto the platform.

### Royal Guard
- `Clean Armor` for Guard 02.
- `Whisper` to Guard 01.

### MTT News
- The Script has the fastest dialogue.
- Defuse the bombs. Start with the lower left and arc around the right side to come back to the middle.
- Recommended order: Book > Script > Present > Basketbomb > Dog > Glass
- You can spam Z+ENTER on the Present and Basketbomb to attack them on the instant the fight starts, which will defuse them.
- The best known time is a 61 upon ending the final bomb.

Say `No...` to watching anime with Alphys. Sorta tricky to hit this if you're mashing but it saves time if you take a moment to GUARANTEE you hit it. Anime is garbage tho

Hitting the second laser (downward puzzle) is faster!

### Slide Puzzle 3 (Down)
Left, Up, Left, Left, Right, Fire

### Slide Puzzle 3 (Up)
Up, Left, Down, Left, Fire

### Miss Muffet
Eat the `Spider Donut` for an instant `SPARE`.

Go back and `SAVE`.

Enter the MTT Musical with the first bit of dialogue, quit the game and reload. Cutscene skipped!

### Musical Puzzle
The Puzzle *is* completable, will upload a map later. The best known time remaining is 10.


### Mettaton Fight 2
- Just attack him once!

## Underground Core

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Madjick | `Talk+Spare` |
Astigmatism | `Flee` | May fail if you don't menu quickly enough.

Blue Blue Orange

Go right when Alphys told you to go up (you have played the game, right??).

At the save point, go left immediately. Then down back to it, up, right, right. Saving at Mettaton wastes time but can be used as a safe strat if you're learning the route.

Go left, then left again towards the puzzle.

### Slide Puzzle 5
Down, Left, Down, Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Fire.

`SAVE` here to heal to full (NOT before Mettaton).

### Mettaton Kai Ni
- Don't fire first turn. Saves dialogue time.
- Check last turn (boxes with bomb in middle as last attack). Saves time.

# `OHHHHH YES!`
- You need 12k ratings to finish the battle. You start with 4k.
- Equip the `Faded Ribbon (+1500 > 5500)`.
- Equip the `Manly Bandanna (+1500 > 7000)`
- Equip the `Old Tutu (+1500 > 8500)`.
- Equip the `Cloudy Glasses (+1500 > 10000)`.
- Equip the `Stained Apron (+1500 > 11500)`. Do this last so you don't have to later.
- The extra 500 points need to be earned by shooting the bombs, MTT minis, squares, and hands. Getting hit gives points.
- Typing `legs` during the essay gives `+350 > 11850`. 150 points should not be difficult to obtain otherwise.
- `toby` makes the dialog faster. Type both.

The battle should be over by now.

## New Home
Mash through everything, as slow as it is. Go to the left key first, saves movement time...or does it?

Grab the `Worn Dagger`. (Box on the left)

Equip the `Stained Apron` and the `Worn Dagger`. Drop a single item.
- Provided you did the Mettaton fight correctly, you'll only have to equip the `Worn Dagger`.

`SAVE` before Judgement.

Once you see the first bit of dialogue with Sans, you can quit the game and reload to spam skip the text.
- Celestics doesn't do this in the WR, probably slower to quit out. Try what you want to.

`SAVE` before the Asgore fight.

### Asgore
- Eat the Butterscotch Pie to lower his defense.
- Don't choke.
- Reminder that blue is stand still, orange is move.

`FIGHT` Asgore after the fight, as it is faster.

## My World

### Omega Flowey
- Phase 1: Knives go the direction `ACT` will be.
- Phase 2: Top left of the room for the `ACT` during the gloves.
- Phase 3: All the way to the right to get to the `ACT`.
- Phase 4: Above the middle for `ACT`, RNG on whether it appears from the left or right.
- Phase 5: Middle pan for the `ACT`. You can move above the pan for this. (12 waves, I think?)
- Phase 6: Close and reload the game as soon as the bullets turn into flowers.
- Don't die?????????

`FIGHT` him afterwards, it's faster. Immediately close and restart the game once the first letter pops up from Flowey.

The instant you see UNDERTALE after entering the door, you can close the game and restart to skip the credits.

Head to Waterfall with the Riverman (or the Riverwoman?).

## Underground Dating Simulator

### Undyne Date
Select the tea when prompted (furthest right). Otherwise, mash through it.

Take the letter to Alphys' Lab.

### Alphys Date
Mash through it????

Head to True Lab.

## True Lab

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Amalgamate (Sink) | `CELL+Refuse+Spare` |
Amalgamate (Dog) | `Stick+Spare` |
Amalgamate (Save) | `Unhug+Hum+Flex+Spare` |
Amalgamate (Fridge) | `Joke+Joke+Joke` |
Amalgamate (Mirror) | `Pray+Mystify+Pick On+Spare` |

Go left first to fight the Sink Amalgamate and grab the key.
- Mash at the first sink instead of turning all three on.
- If you get hit make sure you have full HP before going into the second part of the lab.

Get the key from the bed.

Go downstairs, then right. Fight the Dog Amalgamate, then go left.

Grab the Shower key and head left.

Fight the Save Amalgamate. Head left.

Check the left fridge, and attempt to walk away (to the left). Fight the Fridge Amalgamate.

Grab the Blue Key on the way back to the Bedroom. Insert the Yellow key on the way back as well.

Head right from the Bedroom.

Head right, fight the Mirror Amalgamate.
- For the last phase, if you go behind the body, the heads won't hit you.

Insert the key and head back to the Power Room. Mash through the rest and head back to the elevator.

## The Barrier
`SAVE` before Asgore to heal to full.
- Only have to do this if you get hit in lab since you can't die out of the Asriel fight. Minimal waste of time otherwise.

Mash through everything. It's a lot of mashing.

### Asriel Dreemurr
Wait for the music to kick in (rainbow effects), then `Hope` every time. Don't die and stuff.

### Asriel Dreemurr Kai Ni
`Struggle` for 4 turns. If you got hit by a diamond in the previous phase, you will start at 1/20 HP. If so, kill yourself on turn 1, survive turns 2 and 3, then kill yourself on turn 4. If you do NOT get hit by the diamond, pray that you don't die at all. Remember - dying the first time loses 10 seconds, but if you would probably die anyways, save yourself the time and kill yourself at the start of the attack.

`SAVE` your friends!
- There's a pre-determined amount of actions for each `SAVE`. So you can use the same `ACT` choice twice.
- If you use the Pie while saving Toriel and Asgore, it takes a single action after the Pie.

Don't comfort Asriel. It's faster.

Mash through The End.

Time ends on the last text box from Toriel, in case you forgot.
